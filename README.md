#Â Twitter Hider App

## Getting Started

### What?

Twitter Hider uses Twitter's API to access a user's feed as normal and allow them to manipulate it to their choosing.

Essentially I was sick of always having the results of sports ruined for me on Twitter before I'd had a chance to watch them (I watch a lot of US sport, which is on whilst I'm asleep).

### Why?

* To allow users to set lists on Twitter.
* To allow users to hide lists or individuals on Twitter for a period of chosen time.

### How?

This app has allowed me to practice many topics I have learnt in recent months, including:

* OAuth
* Hapi
* Nodemon
* Redis
* React
* Redux
